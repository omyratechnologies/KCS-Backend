## Authentication

All endpoints require authentication via Bearer token:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

The token provides:
- `user_id` - Current user's ID
- `user_type` - User's role (Student/Teacher/Admin/Super Admin)
- `campus_id` - User's campus ID

## Usage Examples

### Creating an Announcement
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/feeds', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': 'Bearer <token>'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        content: 'School will be closed tomorrow due to weather conditions.',
        type: 'Announcement',
        visibility: 'campus',
        tags: ['urgent', 'closure']
    })
});
```

### Creating a Poll
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/feeds', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': 'Bearer <token>'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        title: 'What should be our next field trip destination?',
        content: 'Help us decide where to go for our next educational trip!',
        type: 'Poll',
        visibility: 'class',
        class_id: 'class_123',
        metadata: {
            poll_options: ['Science Museum', 'Art Gallery', 'Historical Site', 'Nature Park'],
            poll_multiple_choice: false,
            poll_expires_at: '2025-09-20T23:59:59Z'
        }
    })
});
```

### Filtering Feeds
```javascript
// Get all announcements for a specific class
const response = await fetch('/api/feeds?type=Announcement&class_id=class_123&page=1&limit=10', {
    headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer <token>'
    }
});

// Get user's bookmarked feeds
const bookmarks = await fetch('/api/feeds/bookmarks/me', {
    headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer <token>'
    }
});
```
