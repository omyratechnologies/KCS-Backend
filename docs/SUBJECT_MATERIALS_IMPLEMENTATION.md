# Subject Materials Management Implementation

## Overview
I have successfully implemented a comprehensive subject materials management system with CRUD operations, teacher assignments, and permission-based access control as requested. The implementation includes:

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Subject Model
- **Materials Management**: Added support for 4 material types (PDFs, Videos, Worksheets, Presentations)
- **Teacher Assignments**: Each subject can have multiple teachers with roles, hours, and schedules
- **Detailed Metadata**: Each material includes all requested fields:
  - `concept_title`, `status`, `description`, `title`, `size`
  - `upload_by`, `download_count`, `date`, `chapter`, `link`
  - Auto-generated: `id`, `file_type`, `created_at`, `updated_at`

### 2. Enhanced Teacher Model
- Added missing fields as shown in the images:
  - `rating` (0-5 scale)
  - `degree` (PhD, MSc, etc.)
  - `experience_years` (number of years)
  - `specialization` (array of subjects/areas)

### 3. Permission System
- **Admin/Super Admin**: Full CRUD access on all subjects and materials
- **Teachers**: Can only modify materials they uploaded in subjects they're assigned to
- **Teacher Assignment**: Only admins can assign/remove teachers from subjects

### 4. API Endpoints

#### Subject Details
```
GET /subjects/{subject_id}/details
```
Returns subject with material summary and teacher count.

#### Material Management
```
GET    /subjects/{subject_id}/materials/{material_type}           # Get all materials of type
POST   /subjects/{subject_id}/materials/{material_type}           # Add new material
GET    /subjects/{subject_id}/materials/{material_type}/{material_id}  # Get specific material
PUT    /subjects/{subject_id}/materials/{material_type}/{material_id}  # Update material
DELETE /subjects/{subject_id}/materials/{material_type}/{material_id}  # Delete material
POST   /subjects/{subject_id}/materials/{material_type}/{material_id}/download  # Download (increment count)
```

#### Teacher Management
```
POST   /subjects/{subject_id}/teachers                    # Assign teacher
DELETE /subjects/{subject_id}/teachers/{teacher_id}       # Remove teacher
```

### 5. Material Types
- `pdfs` - PDF documents and textbooks
- `videos` - Educational videos and lectures  
- `worksheets` - Practice problems and exercises
- `presentations` - Slide decks and presentations

## Usage Examples

### Adding a Material (Teacher)
```json
POST /subjects/math101/materials/pdfs
Authorization: Bearer {teacher_token}

{
  "concept_title": "Algebra Fundamentals - Chapter 5",
  "status": "Mandatory",
  "description": "Comprehensive guide to algebraic expressions and equations",
  "title": "Algebra Fundamentals - Chapter 5",
  "size": "2.4 MB",
  "chapter": "Chapter 5",
  "link": "https://storage.example.com/algebra-ch5.pdf"
}
```

### Assigning a Teacher (Admin only)
```json
POST /subjects/math101/teachers
Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}

{
  "teacher_id": "teacher_123",
  "role": "Primary Teacher",
  "hours": 18,
  "days": ["Mon", "Wed", "Fri"]
}
```

### Getting Subject Details
```json
GET /subjects/math101/details

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "math101",
    "name": "Mathematics",
    "code": "MATH101",
    "material_summary": {
      "pdfs": {
        "count": 8,
        "items": [...]
      },
      "videos": {
        "count": 6,
        "items": [...]
      },
      "worksheets": {
        "count": 7,
        "items": [...]
      },
      "presentations": {
        "count": 3,
        "items": [...]
      }
    },
    "teachers": {
      "teacher_123": {
        "teacher_id": "teacher_123",
        "role": "Primary Teacher",
        "hours": 18,
        "days": ["Mon", "Wed", "Fri"],
        "assigned_at": "2024-08-12T10:30:00.000Z"
      }
    },
    "teacher_count": 1
  }
}
```

## Security & Permissions

### Teacher Permissions
- Can only add/edit/delete materials they uploaded
- Must be assigned to the subject to add materials
- Cannot assign/remove other teachers

### Admin Permissions
- Full access to all materials and subjects
- Can assign/remove teachers
- Can modify any material

### Permission Checks
The system automatically validates permissions based on:
1. User type (admin vs teacher)
2. Teacher assignment to subject
3. Material ownership (who uploaded it)

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `src/services/subject_materials.service.ts` - Core business logic
- `src/controllers/subject_materials.controller.ts` - API controllers
- `src/schema/subject_materials.ts` - Zod validation schemas

### Modified Files:
- `src/models/subject.model.ts` - Enhanced with materials and teachers
- `src/models/teacher.model.ts` - Added rating, degree, experience
- `src/services/teacher.service.ts` - Added getTeacherByUserId method
- `src/routes/subject.route.ts` - Added new material management routes

## Database Structure

The subject document now contains:
```json
{
  "materials": {
    "pdfs": [/* array of PDF materials */],
    "videos": [/* array of video materials */],
    "worksheets": [/* array of worksheet materials */],
    "presentations": [/* array of presentation materials */]
  },
  "teachers": {
    "teacher_id_1": {
      "teacher_id": "teacher_id_1",
      "role": "Primary Teacher",
      "hours": 18,
      "days": ["Mon", "Wed", "Fri"],
      "assigned_at": "2024-08-12T10:30:00.000Z"
    }
  }
}
```

This implementation provides a complete solution matching the requirements shown in the images, with proper CRUD operations, detailed material metadata, teacher management, and permission-based access control.
